# Introduction

A basic React game to demonstrate simple gaming in React apps without implementing a game engine. The game draws inspiration from the popular 70s game called Whac-a-Mole, where players need to pop balloons to score points.

# Game Features

- Three screens: Start screen, Game screen, and Ending screen.
- Balloon shape constructed from scratch using SVG.
- Implementation of basic SVG elements: ellipse, rect, and polygon.

# Minimal Dependencies

I have intentionally minimized the number of dependencies required for this game, and if necessary, they can be further avoided. The only dependencies utilized in the game are:

- react-transition-group
- classnames

# Game Preview / Demos

Here's a glimpse of the game in action.
